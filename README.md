# üß† Deep Learning Projects Portfolio

Welcome to my Deep Learning portfolio! This repository contains a collection of projects I've built during my journey into machine learning and AI. These projects demonstrate my understanding of core concepts like artificial neural networks (ANN), convolutional neural networks (CNN), recurrent neural networks (RNN), and natural language processing (NLP) using **TensorFlow** and **Keras**.
