# requirements.txt
#
# This file lists the Python packages required to run the Deep Learning projects in this repository.
# It is designed to be used with `pip install -r requirements.txt` to ensure all necessary
# dependencies are installed in your environment.

# Core Deep Learning Libraries
tensorflow==2.16.1      # The main deep learning framework
keras==3.3.3            # High-level API for building and training neural networks (part of TensorFlow or standalone)

# Data Manipulation and Analysis
numpy==1.26.4           # Fundamental package for numerical computation
pandas==2.2.2           # Data structures and analysis tools

# Data Visualization
matplotlib==3.8.4       # Comprehensive library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations
seaborn==0.13.2         # Statistical data visualization based on matplotlib

# Machine Learning Utilities
scikit-learn==1.4.2     # Tools for data mining and data analysis

# Natural Language Processing (NLP) Libraries
nltk==3.8.1             # Natural Language Toolkit for working with human language data
textblob==0.18.0.post0  # Simplified text processing (sentiment analysis, etc.)

# Other potentially useful utilities (add as needed for specific projects)
# ipykernel             # Required for running Jupyter notebooks if not already installed in your environment
# jupyter               # If you plan to run the notebooks interactively
# Pillow                # Image processing library, often a dependency for image-related tasks (e.g., in CNN projects)

# To generate this file from your active environment, you would typically use:
# pip freeze > requirements.txt
#
# Remember to update this file if you add or remove any dependencies from your project.
